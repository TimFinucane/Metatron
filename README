Metatron is a project for generating random sentences.

This works in two parts, firstly a dynamic grammar constructor, which converts rules relating certain grammar parts to other grammar parts in a self-made simplistic DSL similar to a formal grammar production language (e.g. Backus-Naur).
Secondly, a translator that converts from word parts (e.g. Noun) to actual words (e.g. George).
